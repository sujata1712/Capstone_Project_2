# Capstone_Project_2

In modern semiconductor manufacturing, the progress is well-organized to different sensor signals. On the other hand, they are not all the same as some noise data or irrelevant data occur. Engineers often have more signals than needed, so they use feature selection to identify the most relevant ones. These signals can be useful not only in the improvement of the process efficiency but also in the cost reduction and in the assurance of a better understanding of the factors affecting production yield. A detailed consideration of various feature combinations is the key to finding out the signals that bring about a dramatic change in the output.

We purpose to construct a classifier for predicting the Pass/Fail yield of a specific process entity and to evaluate whether all the features are necessary to build the model or not.
